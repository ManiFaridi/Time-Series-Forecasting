# Stock Market Time Series Prediction
### Project Overview
Welcome!
This home project by me, explores the use of deep learning algorithms and neural networks for time series prediction on stock market data. The main goal is to leverage the capabilities of models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
